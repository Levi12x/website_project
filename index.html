    <h3>Welcome to The Coffee Shop!</h3>

    <br>

    <div class="paragraph">
            Welcome to The Coffee Shop! Opened in 2004, The Coffee Shop is a family-run independent business. On it's grand opening, our establishment was spearheaded by our wonderful owner, Susan, now retired. The business carries on with Susan's son, Matt, at the helm as the new co-owner and manager. We pride ourselves on our friendly staff, excellent customer service, quality home-made food and bevergaes, and most of all, our fair prices! 
            <br>
            <br>
            The Coffee Shop is all about the community, and we strive to give back to the wonderful, loyal customers (that's you!) who have helped to keep our little slice of the world going all these years. To view our food and drink menus, feel free to have a look at our drinks and pastries menus. To see our upcoming community events and information on opening hours, head on over to the About page. Feel free to contact us via the form on our website. 
            <br>
            <br>
            We look forward to your visit to The Coffee Shop!
